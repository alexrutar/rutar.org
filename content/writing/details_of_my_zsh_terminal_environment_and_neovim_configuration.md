In this post, I will throughly discuss the configuration files of my personal terminal work environment using Knuth's [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) paradigm.
This is intended, in part, as a personal reference, though this may be useful for inspiration or as a springboard to learn more about how these fundamental tools work.
Notably, I will not spend much time discussing the choice of any tools I use in this document - you can search on the web and read discussions about so-called "optimal" tooling to your heart's desire.
Rest assured that, by using these tools myself, I have already done this and decided for my own use case that this setup is best.

For reference, my operating system is Mac OS and my terminal of choice is [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty).
These discussions should mostly be UNIX-agnostic, though I make no guarantees about this.
