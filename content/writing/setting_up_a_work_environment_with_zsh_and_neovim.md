In this post, I will throughly discuss my personal terminal work environment.
This is intended, in part, as a personal reference, though this may be useful for inspiration or as a springboard to learn more about how these fundamental tools work.
Notably, I will not discuss the choice of any tools I use in this document - you can search on the web and read discussions about so-called "optimal" tooling to your heart's desire.
Rest assured that, by using these tools myself, I have already done this and decided for my own use case that this setup is best.

My operating system is Mac OS and my terminal of choice is [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty).
You can


- IDE emulation
- obsess sessions / persistence
- taboo
- statusline
- vim fugitive
- no swap trick / checktime
- getcwd
- terminal commands
- Taboo customization
- fzf scripts (Fo)
- :cd vs :lcd
- each tab has a purpose and a :lcd
- Using :Files (to search in the current local directory) and :Fo (to search more globally)
